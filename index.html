      This document  defines ShapeUML, a visual notation for RDF constraints. It specifies the visualization primitives to represent constraints to users.

        This document is the result of research and the accompanying paper is currently under submission at the 22nd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW 2020).

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Knowledge Graphs defined with the Resource Description Framework [[RDF]] consist of vocabulary terms and instance data both described using the graph model of RDF.
        Several constraint languages exist to define conditions on such RDF graphs, one such language is the W3C recommended Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]]
        which itself is represented using RDF.
        Users rely on different types of constraints offered by constraint languages to define conditions on RDF graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
        With respect to visual notations, the Unified Modeling Language [[UML]] is widely used in many disciplines.
        A specific UML-profile for RDF [[ODM]] states how RDF classes and properties are mapped to UML classes.
        ShapeUML follows this profile but also adapt graphical symbols to the needs for RDF constraints.

<section>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>

        Throughout the document, the following terminology is used.

    <section>
        <h2>General</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-entity">(anonymous) entity</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                An entity is something that exists as a distinct, independent, or self-contained unit.
                Examples are people, companies, buildings and so on.
                If you want to uniquely address an entity then it needs to have a unique name.
                Therefore, entities use HTTP URIs.
                However, when a entity does not have a URI we call it an <span class="emph">anonymous</span> entity.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-attribute">attribute</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                More information is provided about an entity by adding attribute to it.
                Examples are the name of a person, the VAT number of a company and so on.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-relationship">relationship</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                An entity and its attributes are connected with each other using relationships.
                A relationship describes how a attribute relates to its entity.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-constraints">constraints</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
               A constraint is a condition on data which should be satisfied. Several types of constraints exist,
               e.g. a datatype constraint on a property restricts the value of that property to be of a specific datatype
               and a cardinality constraint on a property restricts the number of that property.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-data-shape">data shape</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
               A data shape is a set of conditions on RDF data.
               It provides context for constraints, i.e. a datatype constraint can be used
               in different data shapes which corresponds to different contexts.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-node-shape">node shape</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
               A node shape is a specific data shape which represents conditions on nodes,
               i.e. subjects and objects of triples.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-property-shape">property shape</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
               A property shape is a specific data shape which represents conditions on properties and their values,
               i.e. predicates and related objects of triples.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-severity">severity</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
               Each data shape has a severity which qualifies the violation of the stated conditions.
               By default a data shape has the severity "violation" but other severities can be defined,
               i.e. the SHACL core specifies the three severities "violation", "warning" and "information".
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Visualization</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-node">node</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                A node is a visual representation of either an entity or an attribute.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-edge">edge</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                An edge is a line connecting two nodes.
                It represents the relationship between two entities or one entity and one attribute.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn id="dfn-graph">graph</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
                A graph is a collection of nodes and edges.
            </dd>
