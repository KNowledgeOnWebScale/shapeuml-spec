## Introduction

Knowledge Graphs defined with the Resource Description Framework [[RDF]] consist of vocabulary terms and instance data both described using the graph model of RDF.
Several constraint languages exist to define conditions on such RDF graphs, one such language is the W3C recommended Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]]
which itself is represented using RDF.
Users rely on different types of constraints offered by constraint languages to define conditions on RDF graphs.


With respect to visual notations, the Unified Modeling Language [[UML]] is widely used in many disciplines.
A specific UML-profile for RDF [[ODM]] states how RDF classes and properties are mapped to UML classes.
ShapeUML follows this profile but also adapt graphical symbols to the needs for RDF constraints.
